The repository contains the Google Earth Engine (GEE) code for the generation of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 composites. The composites contain three bands: VV band and VH band from Sentinel-1 and band 4 from Sentinel-2. These composites were used as input data in the classification of oil palm plantations at the global scale (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3884602).

The code is included in the file ‘create_S1_and_S2_composites.js’ but can be accessed directly in GEE through the following link:
